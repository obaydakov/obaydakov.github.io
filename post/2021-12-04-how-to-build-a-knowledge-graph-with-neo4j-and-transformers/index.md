How to build a knowledge graph from job descriptions using fine-tuned transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and spacyâ€™s relation extraction models. The method described here can be used in any different field such as biomedical, finance, healthcare, etc.

Below are the steps we are going to take:

* Load our fine-tuned transformer NER and spacy relation extraction model in google colab

* Create a Neo4j Sandbox and add our entities and relations

* Query our graph to find the highest job match to a target resume, find the three most popular skills and highest skills co-occurrence
