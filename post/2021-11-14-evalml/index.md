EvalML is an AutoML library which builds, optimizes, and evaluates machine learning pipelines using domain-specific objective functions.

Key Functionality

* Automation - Makes machine learning easier. Avoid training and tuning models by hand. Includes data quality checks, cross-validation and more.

* Data Checks - Catches and warns of problems with your data and problem setup before modeling.

* End-to-end - Constructs and optimizes pipelines that include state-of-the-art preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, and a variety of modeling techniques.

* Model Understanding - Provides tools to understand and introspect on models, to learn how they'll behave in your problem domain.

* Domain-specific - Includes repository of domain-specific objective functions and an interface to define your own.
