      <description>Kubernetes became a de-facto standard in recent years and many of us - both DevOps engineers and developers alike - use it on daily basis. Many of the task that we perform are however, same, boring and easy to automate. Oftentimes it&amp;rsquo;s simple enough to whip up a quick shell script with a bunch of kubectl commands, but for more complicated automation tasks bash just isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, and you need the power of proper language, such as Python.</description>

      <description>Multi-armed bandits have now been studied for nearly a century. While research in the beginning was quite meandering, there is now a large community publishing hundreds of articles every year. Bandit algorithms are also finding their way into practical applications in industry, especially in on-line platforms where data is readily available and automation is the only way to scale.

      <description>Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has become the new state-of-the-art approach in many recommendation problems, with its strong ability to handle structured data and to explore high-order information.	However, as the recommendation tasks are diverse and various in the real world, it is quite challenging to design proper GNN methods for specific problems. In this tutorial, we focus on the critical challenges of GNN-based recommendation and the potential solutions.

      <description>Natural Language Processing remains one of the hottest topics of 2022. By using GitHub stars (albeit certainly not the only measure) as a proxy for popularity, we took a look at what NLP projects are getting the most traction so far this year, just as we recently did with machine learning projects. It’s a list with some familiar names but there are plenty of surprises also!
