      <description>Game-playing artificial intelligence (AI) systems have advanced to a new frontier. Stratego, the classic board game that’s more complex than chess and Go, and craftier than poker, has now been mastered. Published in Science, we present DeepNash, an AI agent that learned the game from scratch to a human expert level by playing against itself.

      <description>This post is related to the recent release of a new open-source project called OpenMetricLearning (OML), and one of its goals is to lower the entry threshold for metric learning pipelines. We will briefly introduce the theory, discuss the examples in code and show how simple heuristics can perform on a level comparable with the current SotA. Since the project is new, each star on GitHub is essential for us.</description>
