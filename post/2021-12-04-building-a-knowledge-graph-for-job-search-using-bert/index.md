In this tutorial, we will build a job recommendation and skill discovery script that will take unstructured text as input, and will then output job recommendations and skill suggestions based on entities such as skills, years of experience, diploma, and major. 

We will extract entities and relations from job descriptions using the BERT model and we will attempt to build a knowledge graph from skills and years of experience.
