Streamlit enables data scientists and machine learning practitioners to build data and machine learning applications quickly. 

In this piece, we will look at how we can use Streamlit to build a face verification application. 

However, before we can start verifying faces, we have to detect them. In computer vision, face detection is the task of locating and localizing faces in an image. Face verification is the process of comparing the similarity of two or more images.
