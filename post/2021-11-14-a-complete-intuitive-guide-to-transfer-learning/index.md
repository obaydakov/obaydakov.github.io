Advancements in deep learning have been rapid over the past decade. 

While the discovery of neural networks happened almost six decades ago with the invention of the first artificial neural network in 1958 by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt (called the "perceptron"), the developments in the field did not gain true popularity until about a decade ago. 

The most popular achievement in 2009 was the creation of ImageNet. ImageNet is a humungous visual dataset that has led to some of the best modern-day deep learning and computer vision projects.
