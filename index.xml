      <description>Multicomputation is one of the core ideas of the Wolfram Physics Project—and in particular is at the heart of our emerging understanding of quantum mechanics. But how can one get an intuition for what is initially the rather abstract idea of multicomputation? A good approach, I believe, is to see it in action in familiar systems and situations. And I explore here what seems like a particularly good example: games and puzzles.</description>

      <description>In this post we will discuss apache parquet, an extremely efficient and well-supported file format. The post is geared towards data practitioners (ML, DE, DS) so we’ll be focusing on high-level concepts and using SQL to talk through core concepts, but links for further resources can be found throughout the post and in the comments.

      <description>PyTorch is designed to be the framework that&amp;rsquo;s both easy to use and delivers performance at scale. Indeed it has become the most popular deep learning framework, by a mile among the research community. However, despite some lengthy official tutorials and a few helpful community blogs, it is not always clear what exactly has to be done to make your PyTorch training to work across multiple nodes.
