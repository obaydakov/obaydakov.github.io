      <description>It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as geometric deep learning, from a variety of published papers. In addition, it consists of easy-to-use mini-batch loaders for operating on many small and single giant graphs, multi GPU-support, distributed graph learning via Quiver, a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on simple interfaces to create your own), the GraphGym experiment manager, and helpful transforms, both for learning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, we will build a job recommendation and skill discovery script that will take unstructured text as input, and will then output job recommendations and skill suggestions based on entities such as skills, years of experience, diploma, and major.
We will extract entities and relations from job descriptions using the BERT model and we will attempt to build a knowledge graph from skills and years of experience.

      <description>How to build a knowledge graph from job descriptions using fine-tuned transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and spacy’s relation extraction models. The method described here can be used in any different field such as biomedical, finance, healthcare, etc.
Below are the steps we are going to take:
  Load our fine-tuned transformer NER and spacy relation extraction model in google colab
  Create a Neo4j Sandbox and add our entities and relations</description>

      <description>FastAPI might be able to help. FastAPI is FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python. We will use FastAPI in this article to build a REST API to service an NLP model which can be queried via GET request and can dole out responses to those queries.
For this example, we will skip the building of our own model, and instead leverage the Pipeline class of the HuggingFace Transformers library.</description>
