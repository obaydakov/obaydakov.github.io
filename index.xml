      <description>Natural Language Processing remains one of the hottest topics of 2022. By using GitHub stars (albeit certainly not the only measure) as a proxy for popularity, we took a look at what NLP projects are getting the most traction so far this year, just as we recently did with machine learning projects. It’s a list with some familiar names but there are plenty of surprises also!

      <description>Multicomputation is one of the core ideas of the Wolfram Physics Project—and in particular is at the heart of our emerging understanding of quantum mechanics. But how can one get an intuition for what is initially the rather abstract idea of multicomputation? A good approach, I believe, is to see it in action in familiar systems and situations. And I explore here what seems like a particularly good example: games and puzzles.</description>

      <description>In this post we will discuss apache parquet, an extremely efficient and well-supported file format. The post is geared towards data practitioners (ML, DE, DS) so we’ll be focusing on high-level concepts and using SQL to talk through core concepts, but links for further resources can be found throughout the post and in the comments.
