As a data scientist, it is important to have a deep understanding of statistics. Here, I introduce basic statistical concepts and quantities.

## Types of measurements and variables

Important statistical concepts include the following:

* Types of measurement scales
* Nomenclature for variables: dependent vs independent variables

## Statistical quantities

You should definitely know about the following, frequently used statistical quantities:

* Centrality measures: [mean and median](/post/basic-statistics/mean_vs_median/), mode
* Measure of dispersion: standard deviation, variance, covariance, interquartile-range
* Interval estimates: confidence intervals

## Probability distributions

Commonly occuring probability distributions are:

* Uniform distribution: all values are equally likely
* Normal distribution: a bell-shaped curve, typical for many population characteristics (e.g. IQs, heights)
* Poisson distribution: an integer distribution that is ideal for count data
* Exponential distribution: a heavy-tailed distribution
