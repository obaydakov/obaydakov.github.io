<p>As a data scientist, it is important to have a deep understanding of statistics. Here, I introduce basic statistical concepts and quantities.</p>
<div id="types-of-measurements-and-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Types of measurements and variables</h2>
<p>Important statistical concepts include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of measurement scales</li>
<li>Nomenclature for variables: dependent vs independent variables</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="statistical-quantities" class="section level2">
<h2>Statistical quantities</h2>
<p>You should definitely know about the following, frequently used statistical quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centrality measures: <a href="/post/basic-statistics/mean_vs_median/">mean and median</a>, mode</li>
<li>Measure of dispersion: standard deviation, variance, covariance, interquartile-range</li>
<li>Interval estimates: confidence intervals</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="probability-distributions" class="section level2">
<h2>Probability distributions</h2>
<p>Commonly occuring probability distributions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uniform distribution: all values are equally likely</li>
<li>Normal distribution: a bell-shaped curve, typical for many population characteristics (e.g.Â IQs, heights)</li>
<li>Poisson distribution: an integer distribution that is ideal for count data</li>
<li>Exponential distribution: a heavy-tailed distribution</li>
</ul>
