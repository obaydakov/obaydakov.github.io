<p>Supervised learning is concerned with models for predicting the outcome for new data points.</p>

<h2>Models for supervised learning</h2>
<p>The following supervised learning models are important:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/tags/linear-model">Linear models</a>: models that assume the existence of a linear relationship between the independent variables and the outcome.</li>
<li>Support vector machines: models that deal with non-linear associations by transforming the data to another space via kernel functions.</li>
<li>Neural networks: models that emulate the interaction of neurons in the nervous system.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbors: a model that classifies a new data point according to its <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nearest neighbors in the training data.</li>
</ul>
