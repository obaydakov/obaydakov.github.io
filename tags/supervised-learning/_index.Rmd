Supervised learning is concerned with models for predicting the outcome for new data points.

## Models for supervised learning

The following supervised learning models are important:

* [Linear models](/tags/linear-model): models that assume the existence of a linear relationship between the independent variables and the outcome.
* Support vector machines: models that deal with non-linear associations by transforming the data to another space via kernel functions.
* Neural networks: models that emulate the interaction of neurons in the nervous system.
* $k$-nearest neighbors: a model that classifies a new data point according to its $k$ nearest neighbors in the training data.
